# Enlivenn: A Study/Social Event App for Students
24h Hackathon Project by Anna, Christie, Iris, Jenn

## The Idea
Meeting new people and being involved is central to students' university experience. This web application aims to build a stronger community by making it easy for students to get involved at UBC, whether through joining small study sessions with classmates, networking at social events, or taking up a new hobby with a club. We want this to be a "one-stop-shop" for all the events happening on campus so students will always be in the loop for exciting activities!

## Proposed Application Features
- Set up a profile, include a profile image and details such as your name, faculty, year and interests.
- View other profiles and see what events they are hosting or attending
- Create an event posting
- Share an event posting and invite friends to join
- Discover activities and events happening on campus, and filter your search based on date/time or type of event (study, social, club, etc.)
- Sign up for notifications for new events posted by people you follow

## Highlights
- Our logo is a Venn diagram, signifying commonality and connection in the student community

## How we built it
Using React.js, SAP UI5 Web Components, Firebase

## Challenges we ran into
We have little experience with Javascript, so figuring out how to organize our directory and write the actual code took lots of time and patience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Submitting this project to cmd-f 2022 Hackathon!

## What we learned
Basic Javascript

## What's next for Enlivenn
We want more of our features to be functional and improve our UX/UI design.
